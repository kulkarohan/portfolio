## About
This page is for artistic thoughts, ideas, vibes, etc. I will update the page whenever I learn and grasp new topics. For now shoes are my main interest, so that is what
will be featured. 

**Note**: Sketches were hand-drawn on classic 8 x 11 notebook paper - you can tell I'm an _absolute_ beginner. I'm learning some technologies such
as [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) for drawing and [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) for modeling which are interesting, but until
I get more comfortable with those you're going to see the classic combination of pencil and paper. 


## Yeezy Sketches

I'm an avid fan of both playing and watching basketball. Although I'm a die-hard Celtics fan, one of my favorite basketball shoes to play in was the Kobe 8.
Based off the Yeezy basketball shoe in-the-making, I sketched a low-top version similar to Kobe's shoe. The comfort of Boost with the fit of a sleek, 
low-cut shoe would instantly be my favorite to rock on the court.

Another Yeezy shoe rumored to release is the Foam Runner. I like the cuts on the sides allowing breathing room even as a low-top. What if a high-top
could also be created?
