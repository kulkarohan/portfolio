# Rohan Kulkarni

I use the internet to learn and data to solve problems. I studied Computer Science at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/) for 3 years prior to substituting my remaining time with the Data Science track at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/), a 9-month online bootcamp. I've become a better learner since leaving college. 

I've done two Co-ops as a Cybersecurity Analyst @ [Day & Zimmermann](https://www.dayzim.com/) (2017) and Data Scientist @ [Verif-y Inc.](https://verif-y.com/) (2018) -- each 6 months. Currently looking for a full-time opportunity, feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat. 

## Interests
Some of my interests include tech history, cryptocurrency, cybersecurity, machine learning, basketball and hip-hop.
