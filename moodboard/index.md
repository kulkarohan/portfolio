## Yeezy Basketball

If I could choose one category of shoes that excites me the most, it would have to be basketball. I'm an avid fan of both playing and watching basketball, and have been since I was a child. Although I'm a die-hard Celtics fan, one of my favorite basketball shoes to play in and look at was the Nike Kobe 8. 

If I could choose one company to help design basketball shoes for it would have to be Yeezy. Not because of the hype, but because the focus is on the product. When I hand-sketch or use software to create, my focus is purely on maximizing the joy I get creating something out of nothing which also happens to look awesome. 

Based off the Yeezy basketball shoe in-the-making, here's a sketch from the side-view of a low-top version also inspired by Kobe's shoe. The comfort of Boost with the fit of a sleek, low-cut shoe would instantly be my favorite to rock on the court.

**Note**: This sketch was hand-drawn on 8x11 notebook paper, you can tell I'm an _absolute_ beginner, and was also the very first one I drew. I plan on updating this page with sketches more designs and different angles.

Also I've begun learning some technologies such
as [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) for drawing and [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) for modeling, but until I get more comfortable with those I'm sticking to the classic combination of pencil and paper.
