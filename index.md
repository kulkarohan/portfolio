I'm a tech, sports, and recent art enthusiast who has transformed from a 'numbers guy' to an 'intuition/feeling guy'. Studying computer science in college had me use data and math to solve problems with exact, pin-point answers; however my mindset has shifted to focus on solving problems creatively with acceptance of imperfection (wabi-sabi).  


## Projects

- [Mood Board](https://kulkarohan.github.io/moodboard) - collection of artistic interests, ideas, inspiration, etc.  
- [NBA Career Longevity Predictor](https://nba-clp.netlify.com/) - select an NBA player to see how many years he is predicted to last in the league as well as his player comparison
- [Twitoff](https://twitoff-kulkarohan.herokuapp.com/) - select twitter users, input text, and let the application predict which user is more likely to tweet the given text
